# Introduction

Welcome to Beacon documentation!

Beacon provides a modern foundation to create a trusted foundation for collecting first-party web analytics using a privacy-first and configurable foundation.

## What is Beacon?

In modern web experiences the collection of behavioral analytics is expected, but consumer trust in how that data is collected and shared is at an all time low.

We've created Beacon to provide a modern foundation to create a trusted foundation for collecting first-party web analytics using a privacy-first and configurable foundation. While there are many solutions in the market for this, it is important to provide education into the patterns of web tracking and create a foundation that allows for flexibility without heavy dependencies.

## What is in the codebase?

A stable framework of strongly typed code with highly testable components and minimal dependencies to provide a clear and stable developer experience and ability to extend as needed.

## What is compiled?

The output of this library is a single minified javascript file called `beacon.js` which can be installed into any web experience and further configured to collect web analytics events. You can get the latest file from [GitHub Pages](https://deloitte.github.io/beacon/beacon.js) or from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Deloitte/beacon/releases) folder.
