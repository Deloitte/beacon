# Overview

## What is Beacon?

> In modern web experiences the collection of behavioral analytics is expected, but consumer trust in how that data is collected and shared is at an all time low. 

We've created Beacon to provide a modern foundation to create a trusted foundation for collecting first-party web analytics using a privacy-first and configurable foundation. While there are many solutions in the market for this, it is important to provide education into the patterns of web tracking and create a foundation that allows for flexibility without heavy dependencies.

## How do you use Beacon?

## [Install The Beacon](/beacon/docs/basics/a-installation)

To add beacon web tracking to a website, you will need to install the `beacon.js` script. This section will show you how to do that

## [Identify Users](/beacon/docs/basics/b-identify-users)

There are many options to how you can identify users from least amount of data, to more robust examples with users and sessions. This area is highly configuration, but important to understand the trade offs.

## [C. Track Behavior](/beacon/docs/basics/c-trackers-and-tags)

When tracking behavior across any property, you will want to use [**trackers**](/beacon/docs/basics/c-trackers-and-tags#trackers) as a simple step to track interaction across a page. When there are gaps or critical elements you want to capture, you can then fill in your collection using [**tags**](/beacon/docs/basics/c-trackers-and-tags#tags).
